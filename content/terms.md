- **Android-** A mobile phone OS built by Google, and based off of the Linux kernel
- **Apache-** A common web server application
- **Bit-** The most basic piece of data. Usually a “0” or a “1”
- **Byte-** Eight bits together make a “Byte”. 1,000,000 bytes in a Megabyte
- **Client-** A piece of computer equipment that uses a service from a server
- **Cloud (The Cloud)-** A term used to describe the Internet, or a server not located on your computer.
- **CompTIA-** Computing Technology Industry Association. A non-profit trade group for the computer industry.
- **CPU (Central Processing Unit)-** The “brain” on a computer
- **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)-** Protocol that automatically assigns IP addresses.
- **DNS (Domain Name Servers)-** The “phone book” of the Internet. Translating IP addresses into Domain Names.
- **Domain Names-** An easy to remember address instead of an IP address.
- **FAT (File Allocation Table)-** An older file system that can be used by most operation systems
- **GUI (Graphical User Interface)-** This is what most people interact with on a regular basis when using computers. It’s the icons you click to open programs and to change settings.
- **HDD (Hard Disk Drive)-** Data storage device that uses spinning magnetic discs to store and retrieve data.
- **HDMI (High-Definition Multimedia Interface)-** A multimedia connector used to transmit video, audio, and more through a single cable.
- **HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)-** Markup language that makes up most web pages
- **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)-** A protocol for data transmission that forms the backbone of the internet
- **HTTPS (HTTP over SSL)-** A communication protocol that provides data integrity and security. Provides an HTTP connection with SSL security.
- **IP Address (Internet Protocol)-** An address of a location computer/device on the internet.
- **IPv4-** Internet Protocol version 4. A common 32-bit form of IP address. Example = 192.168.1.1
- **IPv6-** Internet Protocol version 6. A successor to IPv4 using 128-bit hexadecimal versions of IP Addresses. Example = 2001 =0db8 =0000 =0042 =0000 =8a2e =0370 =7334,
- **LEMP Stack-** A method of deploying web applications. It uses the following programs = Linux, Nginx, MySQL, and PHP
- **Linux-** An open source Operating System. Considered to be lightweight, powerful, and more flexible than many other operating systems. The downside is that it is not as broadly supported as Windows or OSX. Can come in many different flavors based off of a user’s needs.
- **Nginx-** Pronounced “Engine X”. A modern web server similar to Apache. Considered to be more lightweight and faster than Apache.
- **NTFS (New Technology File System)-** A newer proprietary file system (similar to FAT) developed by Microsoft.
- **Open Source-** Computer software where the code is freely available to be built and developed. This is code that can be sued by anyone, anywhere, for any purpose, and for free.
- **OS (Operating System)-** The software that handles the basic functions of a computer. It determines how other applications and hardware run on a machine.
- **ownCloud-** An open-source program for storing data in your own personal cloud server.
- **PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor)-** A scripting language used to build web pages
- **Ports-** Logical communication points that tell a computer to send certain types of data
- **Python-** A programming language
- **RAM (Random Access Memory)-** Memory that is used to run applications. Having excess RAM will generally speed up a system. RAM is volatile memory, meaning that Information stored in RAM disappears with a loss of power.
- **Server-** To quote Wikipedia = [“In computing, a server is a computer program or a device that provides functionality for other programs or devices, called ‘clients'”.](https =//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing))
- **Shell-** An interface that allows a user to directly interact with an operating system. Commonly used in Linux.
- **SSD (Solid State Drive)-** Uses non-volatile Flash memory to store information. There are no moving parts, making it faster and more resistant to shock than a traditional HDD. The cost associated with SSDs can be prohibitive when you approach larger amounts of memory.
- **SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)-** Protocol that provides encryption over data networks.
- **Raspberry Pi-** A computer the size of a deck of cards developed by the Raspberry Pi Foundation. It supports multiple operating systems and can be configured to any number of applications.
- **Raspbian-** A lightweight flavor of Linux designed to run on a Raspberry Pi.
- **Ubuntu-** A popular flavor of Linux built by Canonical
- **URL (Uniform Resource Locator)-** A web address
- **USB (Universal Serial Bus)-** A standard variety of connectors for transferring data and power. There are several different designs and an ever evolving protocol
- **VPN (Virtual Private Network)-** A private network that is encrypted and used to cross an open public network. Like a tunnel.
- **Windows-** The most common desktop Operating System owned by Microsoft
