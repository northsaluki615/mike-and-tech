There was a phishing email going through Gmail earlier today, and Googleâ€‹ pretty much solved the problem, but&#8230; Here's some thoughts.

Don't open it. It is from hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh@mailinator.com, and looks like someone is sharing a document with you. They're not. 

Delete it.

If you already opened it, change your password ASAP.

Also go here:https//myaccount.google.com/permissions and remove permissions for 'Google Docs' if it appears there. This is a really well-done phishing attack.
