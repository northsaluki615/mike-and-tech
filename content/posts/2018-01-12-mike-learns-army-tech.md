I assume most of you have noticed that not much content has been put out in the last couple months. I apologize for that. I've been busy. Back in September, I mentioned a crazy idea I had to my wife, and after a long conversation, I decided to move forward. In November, I officially became a member of the United States Army Reserve.

I have enlisted in the Army with a MOS of 25U, or Signal support systems specialists. From the Army's website, 'Signal support systems specialists are primarily responsible for working with battlefield signal support systems and terminal devices. This equipment needs to consistently work in order for the Army to direct the movement of its troops. '

I will be learning much about radios, LANs, and other IT services. I hope to translate these skills that will help move my career forward and provide inspiration for new projects to post here.

Thank you for reading this blog over the last year, and I will be back in the second half of 2018 with more projects.
