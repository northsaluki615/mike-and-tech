## A bit of housekeeping

Over the last year I haven't published much. This is mostly due to being busy with other stuff. I plan to do better in 2019.  One of the most immediate chagnes is the URL of this site. It is now [helmers.io](https//helmers.io)

I want to branch out about what I write, and will be using [mikehelmers.com](https//mikehelmers.com) as a place for me to explore all aspects of my life, not just technology.

Mike Learns Tech will continue, with new and exciting projects. Thank you for your support, and I can't wait to share what I've been up to!
