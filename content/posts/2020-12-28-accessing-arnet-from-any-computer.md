If you are in the Army Reserves, you probably know the pain of completing military tasks on a civilian computer. There are several Army sites/applications that only function on an Army network, and you probably don't have access to that in your home. Well, the Army Reserve has a workaround that they don't advertise. You can access ARNet from any computer that you can install Citrix Receiver on.

This is important because it is a pain to get your ARNet account reactivated. Plus, if the Army needs you to complete a document at home, this great expands your abilities.

## Requirements

- An ARNet Account which [you can request here](https =//aramp.usar.army.mil/). You need to be on a Army Reserve network to request this. Talk to your S6/Commo person for help.
- Windows 10 - This is just easier than using Linux or MacOS because of your CAC will interact with the applications
- [Citrix Workspace app](https =//www.citrix.com/content/citrix/en_us/downloads/workspace-app/windows/workspace-app-for-windows-latest.html)- This is what will connect to ARNet. Support for this app is [located on Citrix's website](https =//www.citrix.com/products/receiver.html).

#### For Army Reservist who are deployed/mobilized

There's a strong chance you can still install an older version of Citrix Workspace called Citrix Receiver on your NIPR computer and keep your ARNet account active.

1. Navigate to the "Start Menu" on your NIPR computer
2. Type "Software Center" and select the app
3. Select the "Applications" tab on the left
4. Click on the "Citrix Receiver" icon and click "Install"

This will install Citrix Receiver on your computer and allow you to proceed with the instructions.

## Logging into ARNet Remotely

1. Ensure Citrix Workspace/Receiver is intalled.
2. Open your web browser and navigate to the following URL = [https =//rasxtra.usar.army.mil/](https =//rasxtra.usar.army.mil/)
3. Select your “Authentication Certificate” and enter your PIN when prompted
4. If successful, you’ll see an USARC Alert message, click “Accept”
5. You will see a Citrix Receiver Screen. Click “Detect Receiver”
6. You’ll see a message stating that “This site is trying to open Citrix Receiver”. Check the box that says “Always allow”, and click “Open”
7. If nothing happens, select “Already installed”
8. Select the appropriate Certificate from your CAC (Note = not the EMAIL one)
9. The next screen you see should the ***US Army Reserve Remote Access Portal***. Select “AR Desktop”
10. Select the appropriate Certificate from your CAC (Note = not the EMAIL one)
11. Enter your PIN and click “Log On”
12. A file will download. Open it
13. Citrix will launch, follow the Authentication Requests and enter your PIN as needed
14. Click “OK” proceed to the next logon screen
15. At this screen log onto the virtual machine just like any other Army Computer
16. The next screen you see should the ***US Army Reserve Remote Access Portal***. Select “AR Desktop”
17. A virtual ARNet Desktop will load and you can do all your army work remotely! Hooah!

***Worth noting, this system is finicky, and will occasionally be down.***

### Help for this application goes out to an unknown Sergeant from a random exercise I went to who sent me down this path. I also received some guidance from [Military CAC](https =//militarycac.com/rap.htm)
