Hey, there! I've got a brief update. I've added a ['Tech Terms'](https//mikehelmers.com/terms/) page the website. As I write these articles, I find that I'm constantly defining some terms that I use. Now, this blog is for beginners and tinkerers alike, so I want to cater to everyone. Going forward, if you are wondering what I'm talking about, click on over to the [Tech Terms](https//mikehelmers.com/terms/) page and learn something new.

In the coming weeks, I have several articles in the works, and I can't wait to share my new projects with you!
